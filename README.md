This project is a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with types of products: coffee beans, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since money doesn't grow on trees, our coffee machine collects money too.
